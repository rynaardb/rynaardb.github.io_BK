# Uses

A list of hardware, software, and tools I use regularly, if not daily.

I change up things sometimes, so this page will serve as a living document and a place to point curious developers to when I get asked.

This is page is inspired by [uses.tech](https://uses.tech/) by [Wes Bos](https://wesbos.com/).

## Hardware

At home, I use a Macbook Pro with a docking setup. This works well for me because it offers me the option to be mobile when I'm traveling and a desktop experience when working from home.

* [Apple Macbook Pro 15" 2017](https://support.apple.com/kb/SP756?locale=en_US) - My daily driver and it is still going strong.
* [Apple Magic Mouse 2 Space Gray](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MRME2LL/A/magic-mouse-2-space-gray) - Not bad, neither great. I'm looking to replace it with a Logitech MX Master 3 in the future.
* [Apple Magic Keyboard Space Gray](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MRMH2LL/A/magic-keyboard-with-numeric-keypad-us-english-space-gray) - Only serves as a backup keyboard.
* [Keychron K6 mechanical keyboard](https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-k6-wireless-mechanical-keyboard?variant=31440990142553) (Gateron Brown switches) - I really love this keyboard! The Geteron Brown switches have a great feel and sound to it.
* [Razor Core X Thunderbolt 3 eGPU](https://www.razer.com/gaming-egpus/Razer-Core-X/RC21-01310100-R3U1) - Houses my Vega 64 which is always connected to my Macbook Pro when docked at home.
* [Asus Strix Vega 64 GPU](https://www.asus.com/Graphics-Cards/ROG-STRIX-RXVEGA64-O8G-GAMING/) - The best GPU in terms of compatibility with macOS. I use it mainly for machine learning stuff and video editing.
* [LG 38WK95C Ultrawide Curved Monitor](https://www.lg.com/us/monitors/lg-38WK95C-W-ultrawide-monitor) - Great monitor with good color accuracy. It's big enough to only need the one monitor on my desk. 
* [Samsung X5 Thunderbolt 3 External SSD](https://www.samsung.com/semiconductor/minisite/ssd/product/portable/x5/) - An extremely fast external SSD, even faster than my internal SSD.
* [Samsung T5 External SSD](https://www.samsung.com/semiconductor/minisite/ssd/product/portable/t5/) - I have a few of these which I use to store my data and backups.
* [Twelve South Curve Laptop Stand](https://www.twelvesouth.com/products/curve-for-macbook?variant=9173811757113) - I keep my Macbook Pro mainly in clamshell mode on the stand.
* [Elgato Thunderbolt 3 Dock](https://www.elgato.com/en/dock/thunderbolt-3) - Provides additional inputs when my Macbook Pro is docked at home.
* [Elgato Stream Deck](https://www.elgato.com/en/gaming/stream-deck) - I use this to automate my workflow.
* [Blue Yeti X Microphone](https://www.bluemic.com/en-us/products/yeti-x/) - Mainly for video calls, meetings, etc.

## Software

I use dark themes for pretty much everything, including all IDEs, apps, and macOS. The software I choose to use needs to either add value to my workflow or serve a specific purpose.

### Development & Design

* [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) - Being primarily an iOS Developer, this is where I spend most of my time in.
* [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - The best text editor in my opinion with a rich set of features and third-party extensions.
* [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/index.html) with [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) - For everything terminal related. No terminal setup is complete without [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki). I also use the terminal as my git client.
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) with [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/gettingstarted/) - Helps me keep my machine lean when developing applications locally.
* [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) - For all backend / API development. I'm also using Postman for stubbing services locally during development.
* [VMware Fusion](https://www.vmware.com/products/fusion.html) - I run Windows and other operating systems as virtual machines.
* [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/) - My preferred UI/UX design tool.
* [Rotato](https://www.rotato.xyz/) - Great tool for creating slick mockups and videos of mobile and other apps.

### Desktop Apps

* [Keyboard Maestro](https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/) - Great for automating just about anything on your Mac. I have several useful automations I use daily.
* [1Password](https://1password.com/) - Another app I use multiple times a day. Everything private and sensitive goes right to 1Password.
* [Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/) - My preferred task management tool. I use it mainly as an inbox in my [GTD](https://gettingthingsdone.com/) system.
* [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) - What I use to organize my life.
* [DEVONthink](https://www.devontechnologies.com/apps/devonthink) - For collecting and organizing all my documents and research.
* [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) - I'm current looking at implementing the [Zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.de/) method for my notes and research.
* [Tweetbot](https://tapbots.com/tweetbot/mac/) - My twitter client of choice. I like being able to set up my timelines based on specific hashtags etc.
* [Karabiner-Elements](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/) - To remap some of the keys on my Keychron K6 keyboard.

## Other Gear

* [iPad Pro 12.9 2018](https://www.gsmarena.com/apple_ipad_pro_12_9_(2018)-9387.php) - This thing is a beast and although it is not a laptop replacement for me, I have it set up for writing, coding and video editing.
* [iPhone XS Max](https://www.gsmarena.com/apple_iphone_xs_max-9319.php) - Not just my phone but also use it as my main development device.
