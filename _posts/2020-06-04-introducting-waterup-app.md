I recently [published](https://apps.apple.com/app/waterup-water-tracker/id1483094866) my first standalone watchOS app for Apple Watch called WaterUP, using SwiftUI.

{% include gallery caption="WaterUP - Water Tracker for Apple Watch" %}

WaterUP tracks your daily water intake and reminds you to drink water and stay hydrated throughout the day. Having suffered from kidney stones in the past I know firsthand how important it is to stay hydrated. Just thinking about the pain alone is enough reason for me to make sure I stay hydrated. Spending so much time sitting in front of my computer screen coding away it becomes really easy to forget to stay hydrated. And no, coffee doesn't count.

Before I came up with the idea to actually develop WaterUP, I looked around on the App Store and couldn't really find any apps that is just simple and to the point. All I wanted was to log my water intake and set my schedule to be reminded via push notifications. Also, I wanted this to be a standalone watchOS app and to not have to worry about an iOS companion app which I will most likely never use.

This was the perfect opportunity to solve my own problem / need and to also learn SwiftUI in the process. Fast forward a couple of week later and lots of learning, frustration and joy I finally finished the app and published it on the App Store.

I've learned a lot in the process while developing WaterUP and I plan on writing a few posts in the coming weeks sharing my experiences working with SwiftUI, Combine, HealthKit and a couple of other general standalone watchOS app related topics.

And remember, wash your hands, wear your mask and stay hydrated.
