As a DevOps practitioner, you're probably always on the lookout for ways to improve your workflow and make your job easier. One way to do this is by using command-line tools or CLI tools. CLI tools are programs that run in the terminal or command prompt, and they can help you automate repetitive tasks, manage your infrastructure, and more. In this blog post, we'll explore some of my favorite CLI tools.

If you're using Amazon Web Services (AWS), the AWS CLI is a must-have tool. It allows you to manage your AWS resources using a CLI, including EC2 instances, S3 buckets, and more. 

The AWS CLI is an essential tool if you need to manage AWS resources programmatically.
