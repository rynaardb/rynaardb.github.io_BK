<h1 id="waterup">WaterUP</h1>
<h2 id="privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>I take your privacy very seriously, especially when dealing with data as sensitive as your health data. To that end I&#39;ve designed WaterUP from the ground up to ensure that your data stays completely private.</p>
<p>No information at all is ever transmitted outside of your device.</p>
<p>Unless you ever email me for support, I will have no information about you or what you do within the app.</p>
<p>All interactions with your health profile and data are done via the watchOS system frameworks. Which are themselves controlled by your privacy choices.</p>

<p>(Now for the legal boilerplate part of the Privacy Policy, I always prefer to start with plain english before I get into that part of things.)</p>
<h3 id="personally-identifying-information">Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
<p>WhaterUP does not gather or transmit any Personally-Identifying Information outside of your local device. It only stores preferences and water tracking data within its own database. Your health profile and data is only used to make daily water intake recommendations.</p>
<h3 id="business-transfers">Business Transfers</h3>
<p>If WaterUP, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that WaterUP goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, this policy and its effects may change or be amended. (As WaterUP does not collect any information about you there is very little effect this would likely have in practice.)</p>
<h3 id="privacy-policy-changes">Privacy Policy Changes</h3>
<p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, WaterUP may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in WaterUP&#39;s sole discretion. Your continued use of this app after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>
<h3 id="indemnity">Indemnity</h3>
<p>You hereby indemnify us and undertake to keep us indemnified against any losses, damages, costs, liabilities and expenses (including, without limitation, legal expenses and any amounts paid by us to a third party in settlement of a claim or dispute on the advice of our legal advisers) incurred or suffered by us arising out of any breach by you of any provision of these terms of use, or arising out of any claim that you have breached any provision of these terms of use.</p>
